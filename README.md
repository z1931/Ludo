## How to Play

Ludo is simple to play. Hereâ€™s a quick guide:

1. **Setup**: Each player selects a color and places their four pieces in their respective starting area.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: Players take turns rolling a die. A player must roll a six to move a piece out of the starting area.
3. **Moving Pieces**: Players move their pieces according to the number rolled. The goal is to move all four pieces to the home area.
4. **Capturing Opponents**: If a player lands on a square occupied by an opponent, the opponent's piece goes back to the starting area.
5. **Winning**: The first player to move all their pieces to the home area wins the game!
